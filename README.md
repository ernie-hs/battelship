# BATTLESHIP

a crappy version of battleship for the fun of it.

:gabor edition!!!!

**work in progress**

## command line

start with,

```npm install```

if you want to run it from npm,

```npm run watch```

if you want to have the test cases in a browser,

```npm run browser-test```

run both and you will now have two ports open, 

for the app http://localhost:8700

for the tests http://localhost:8021

## emacs

run it from emacs using cider,

```M-x cider-jack-in-cljs```

when prompted choose, ```shadow``` then ```:app```

you can go to the dashboard on http://localhost:9630 to start the browser-test (builds -> watch browser-test).

off you go...
